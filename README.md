# Code-quiz-ahmed
The purpose of coding quiz was to allow the user to answer a quiz and keep track of their highscores as the quiz uses local storage to create a list of the most recent highscores for user(s) to compete against each other or themselves. 

I used variables to link to the html ID's as well as an object containing the question material and then began creating functions which first started the function with a timer. Then another that produced the questions with their options. A third which determined the correct and wrong answers and gave a penalty for any incorrect answers. A fourth function to end the quiz which is used repeatedly where neccessary. The final function stores and displays the data from the final score so that it can be referenced later on.
